Pet Dog in Stanford 
(click to skip)


No undergraduate housing in campus 
allows the students to keep their pet. 

But by the great power of CS106A, 
this program allows you to
find your own personal pet dog 
(dog with the size and color you want), 
give it a name, and go back to your dorm 
with your new pet dog. 

Within the canvas, catch the dog 
you want to keep as your pet by
clicking on the dog you want. 

If you don’t see any dog you want, 
(1)
TYPE the size (small or big) and
TYPE the color (11 set colors) and 
PRESS the ‘DESIGNED Dog’ button. 
(2) 
PRESS the ’New Dog’ button. 

Keep in mind that you can only have
maximum 15 dogs in your selection. 
If you want to send all dogs away, 
PRESS ‘All Away’ button. 

Another few things to keep in mind: 
1) the dogs are competing with each other! 
They will eat each other up 
if you choose too slowly. 
2) The dogs may also go outside the canvas & 
come back later. No worries :) 
3) Once you choose your dog, you cannot 
choose another dog! So be responsible 
for your catch. 
4) Try to keep your name & 
the dog’s name short! 

The rest is up to you to figure them out!
ENJOY :)
